# OrthoApp

A medical teaching application focused on joint movement analysis and education. OrthoApp helps medical students, healthcare professionals, and educators understand and teach joint biomechanics through interactive camera-based motion tracking.

## Overview

OrthoApp is designed to assist in medical education by providing tools for analyzing and teaching joint movements. The app utilizes camera technology to track and visualize joint motion, making it an invaluable resource for orthopedic education and clinical training.

## Features

- **Camera-based Motion Tracking**: Real-time joint movement analysis using device camera
- **Educational Tools**: Interactive learning modules for understanding joint biomechanics
- **Medical Teaching Resources**: Comprehensive materials for teaching joint movement patterns
- **Cross-platform Support**: Available on iOS, Android, and Web

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI

### Installation

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Development

This project is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and uses React Native for cross-platform mobile development.

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the Expo development server
- `npm run android` - Run on Android device/emulator
- `npm run ios` - Run on iOS device/simulator
- `npm run web` - Run in web browser
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Technology Stack

- **Expo**: React Native framework for building cross-platform apps
- **React Native**: Mobile app development framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Expo Camera**: Camera functionality for motion tracking
- **Expo Router**: File-based routing system

## Medical Use Cases
